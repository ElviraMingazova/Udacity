    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "#### Decision Trees\n",
    "- In buisness decision trees can be applied by an HR departmen in order to select proper candidates from all the applications received using certain criteria and thresholds.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Decision trees are very intuitive, we can follow the decision making process from the begining to the end, we can easily interpret the results. The tree structure also has a natural visualization, with its nodes and edges. It performs well when we have feature interaction in the data. The interaction between two features is the change in the prediction that occurs by varying the features after considering the individual feature effects. (Source: https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/tree.html)\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Decision trees tend to overfit (remember the train data exactly), for this reason one usually needs to restrict the max. depth of the tree or number of samples in the leaf nodes, etc. They can be extremely sensitive to small perturbations in the data: a slight change can result in a drastically different tree (non-smoothness) (Source: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/1292/what-is-the-weak-side-of-decision-trees). DT perform poorly when there is a linear relationship between an input feature and the outcome. In the case of DT this linear split has to be approximated by a step function which is inefficient. (Source: https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/tree.html)\n",
    "  \n",
    "- The features seem to have inner interactions, for instance, between education level and workclass. Also I think that the relationship between all the features and the outcome is not linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ensemble Method - AdaBoost\n",
    "General: Ensemble methods help to combine multiple “weak classifiers” into a single “strong classifier” (Source: Nanodegree \"Data Scientist for Enterprise\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adaptive boosting can be used in medical diagnostics. Weak learners are so-called decision stumps that split the data upon only one feature each. For example, diabetes can be predicted from BMI, Waist Circumference and blood manganese levels. Adaptive boosting will identify upon the error rates which decision stump should gain more weight in the combined strong learner. (Source: https://hackernoon.com/under-the-hood-of-adaboost-8eb499d78eab).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Strenths of the model: not many hyperparameters to tune (we need to decide on the base classifier and on the number of boosting rounds only); voting among low complexity weak learners --> harder to overfit; in each round weights of the datapoints are updated and weak lerners can focus on harder-to-classify examples. Performs well in the classification problems. (Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdaBoost, http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/vip/teach/MLcourse/4_boosting/slides/boosting.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weakness of the model: sensitive to outliers. Performs poorly on noisy data. (Sourse: Control Engineering and Information Systems, edited by Zhijing Liu)\n",
    "\n",
    "- It usually performs good in the classification problems like ours; data is not noisy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logistic regression\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is used to provide estimations of what an outcome will be based on past experiences. For example, it can be used in wheather forecasting to predict if it's gonna rain on a specific day in a specific city.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strengths: not only gives final classification, but also probabilities for each point belonging to one or another class; efficient in training. Good for the problems where the dependent variable is categorical, the explanatory variables can take any form. (Source: https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/logistic.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weaknesses: likelihood function won’t converge if there is a full separation in the data meaning there is a feature that would perfectly separate the two classes (this is because the weight for that feature would not converge, because the optimal weight would be infinite). Performs poorly when the features are dependent from each other or when they are highly correlated with each other. (Source: https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/logistic.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have a classification task; features seem to be independent and not multicollinear; maybe it will be a problem that we have too many features in our transformed dataset."

    "#### Adaptive boosting\n",
    "Here we can draw an analogy with a committee and its members. Each weak learner is a simple 1-level decision tree (also called decision stump) - a member of a committee. Each member might have a limited power to take an optimal decision, while it is believed that a whole committee voting will perform better than a single member. The same principle is applied in the adaptive boosting. A weak learner classifies the whole data set upon only one feature. While it does misclassify a lot of points it is still better than a random classifier.\n",
    "  \n",
    "AdaBoost peaks its weak learners in such a way that every weak learner can infer something new about the data. AdaBoost maintains a distribution of weights over all datapoints. In each round of boosting the weights are updated so that the misclassified points are assigned with greater weights. The next learner can then focuse more on the mistakes of the previous learner and try to do better. At the end all the weak learners are combined into a single ensemble of learners. The combination is a weighted sum, so each learner gets its weight according to the achieved accuracy. If a weak learner has an accuracy of 50% - it corresponds to the random classification and absolutely no gain of information after the data split - it gets zero weight. The higher the accuracy - the higher the weight of a single learner in the ensemble.

    "- AdaBoost. My expectation was correct to some extent. I correctly identified educational level, age, capital gain and loss as the important features but I totally messed up with the ranking. Didn't think that capital gain and loss will have such a predictive power. However, thinking about capital gain it totally makes sense. Education level is less important than I thought. Hours per week are on the 5th place, but almost contribute nothing to the prediction.\n",
    "- Random Forest show different set of the most important features which is seems to be really interesting to me. Somehow if a person is married to another civil person - then he or she is more likely to earn more money. Also if a person is a husband and not a single or unmarried. This makes sense to me since probably the more responsibilities you have to take, the more wishes and needs arise even in a small family, the more support you get - the more potential and motivation to earn money. The most strange thing to me is that at the same time on the 5th place in the feature ranking is \"never-married\" which is quite contradictory to the \"husband\" status which is on the second place. Maybe ones who have never been married also never get divorsed and don't loose capital? I would never come up with such a list of features as the one from the RF-algorithm."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
